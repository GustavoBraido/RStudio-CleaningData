#Load data
df<-read.csv("https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/HollywoodsMostProfitableStories.csv")

#Now the data is loaded, lets take a look
View(df)

#remember case sensitivity
View(df)

#After executing this command, a new window has appeared with the dataset. Here we can see the column names and the rows containing data.
#Now it is time to load up the library in order to sort and clean through the data, and perform analysis techniques.
install.packages("tidyverse")

#Now that the package has been installed, we can go ahead and import the libary.
library(tidyverse)

#Once the library has been imported, we can go ahead and start looking through the dataset. I will start off by checking data types,followed by some data cleaning techniques.
str(df)
colSums(is.na(df))

#The command above searches for missing values in the df. The following command will drop the missing values.
df<-na.omit(df)

#To check whether the values have been dropped or not, we can execute the following command
colSums(is.na(df))

#All missing values haven now been dropped from the df.
#Another step in the data cleaning process is to check for duplicates
dim(df[duplicated(df$Film),])[1]

#######################To make the df easier to read, we will round off values to 2 decimal places
df$Profitability<-round(df$Profitability.digit=2)

#Watch out for mistakes in the command, like spelling, using wrong signs etc. I will re-write the command now
df$Profitability<-round(df$Profitability, digit=2)

#Now let's see the df
dim(df)

#Checking for outliers is an important step of the data cleaning process. Outliers can be an indicator of bad data
